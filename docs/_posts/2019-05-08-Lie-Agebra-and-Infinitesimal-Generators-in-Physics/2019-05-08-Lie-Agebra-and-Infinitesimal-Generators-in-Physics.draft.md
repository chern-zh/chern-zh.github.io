**defnition of infintestmal operators**

```
Infinitesimal Group Actions
Just as a one-parameter group of transformations is generated as the flow of a vector
field, so a general Lie group of transformations G acting on a manifold M will be generated
by a set of vector fields on M, known as the infinitesimal generators of the group action.
Each infinitesimal generatorâ€™s flow coin

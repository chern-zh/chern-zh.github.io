## Anyons as Quasi-particles

A feasible realization of such anyons is to use quasi-particles on $2$D lattice, by either introducing defects or use flux tubes. The braiding is therefore realized by the motion of the various order parameter defects (vortices, domain walls, etc.) or the flux tubes. The following gif (first and last frame last for $1.5$ second) shows that two lower zero modes are braided due to flux tubes' movement. [^5]

Such braiding can also be realized on a $1$D nanowire as long as there is a T-junction as in[^1][^2]. The process is like trying make a [three-point turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_turn)

More complicated realizations of zero modes and their braiding will be discussed in later posts.

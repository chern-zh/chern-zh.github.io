Humanity is meeting its end. Everything is too late. 

Blinded by the huge advance in science and technology in the past few thousands year, we have become too arrogant to give the sky a glimpse. After coals burnt out, we found oil. After oil burnt out, we found gas. After that we have hydrogen, then helium, then fusion of arbitrary elements. The entire solar system has been colonized and populated. Poverty is long gone. Equality has long been here. We have built our own paradise, and have became God. 

It all happened so soon. One day an amateur astrophysicist looked at some data and found a irregularity. It was so strange that everyone overlooked it and thought it was an error. He pulled data from all detector allover the world. To his horror, the data confirms that this anomality is universal. The explanation is simple, either all observatory around the world broke down at the same time, or there is something enormous moving fast towards us. It's approximately three times wider than our galaxy, and is moving towards us at three percent of speed of light. 

There is no escape. It's too late. Even if we move at the speed of light, we wouldn't be able to escape. The collision will break everything apart, including our solar system. And even if we survived that, our planets' orbit will to so unstable and probably spiral into the sun, or a sun.

After a short period of depression, scientists soon mustered up and started working on **Project Easter** in a tragic spirit of Sisyphus. 

The project can be summarized in two words. We existed. 

As far as we know, we are alone in the universe. If millions year ago, a civilization come by the ruin of our solar system, they can know that we existed. We might have been prosperous, might have been violent, but we existed on this universe, achieved a high level of intelligence. When our death is inevitable, we need to proof that we existed, even if everything we do does not mean anything anymore.

What should we leave? 

Thousands years later, we could not build anything more stable and durable than a big stone. Leaving a huge stone is not going to last long enough. It should last longer than a block of stone.

Sending gold disks in all directions is not a good idea, either. Nor is sending radio waves. A few light years away, the chance of the space craft or signal to be captured is scarce. Let alone erosion or distortion.

### 4020, Mar, 1<sup>th</sup>

A high school student's proposal dazzled everyone. He said that we should leave a life. 

Since we have not discovered any neighbors or any residents for that matter in the universe, the chance of alien finding our ruin is small. We could create a life form so that our off-spring could marvel over our power. We need of course need to leave hints that they did not emerge from pure evolution like we did.

The project is initiated today. I was chosen as one of the chief leaders as a physicist.

### 4020, Mar, 4<sup>th</sup>

We I was working on the project, it suddenly occurred to me that the universe might be designed. The constants are so carefully chosen.

Are we too dull to understand our maker, whatever that means?

### 4020, Mar, 6<sup>th</sup>

They kept me in the mental hospital for telling others about our universe was designed. I understand that. In desperate times people are more easily subject to superstitions. It would be trouble if some cult used that idea.

All I can think about is what happened to the ones that designed this universe? Did they die like we did?

### 4070, Jan, 1<sup>st</sup>

It's been 50 years. We have make no progress. It's pretty hard trying to play God huh.

I think my diary should end today.

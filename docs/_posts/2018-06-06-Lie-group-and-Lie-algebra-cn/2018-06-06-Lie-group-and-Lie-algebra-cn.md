description: My understanding of Lie-group and its Lie-algebra. The statement "Lie-algebra is approximation of Lie-group" is inaccurate since they essentially live in different spaces. This post is not finished. Check posts under [`Lie Group`](https://yk-liu.github.io/blog/tags#Lie-group) and/or [`Lie Algebra`](https://yk-liu.github.io/blog/tags#lie-algebra) where I rewrote and added more aspects of Lie group and Lie algebra.

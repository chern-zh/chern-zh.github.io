## Naïve set theory

## Basics of Sets

- A **set** is a collection of distinct objects.
- Specially, a collection of sets is called a **family of sets**.
- All the subsets of set $S$ is called the **power set** $\Pset{S}$.

## Relations

### Ordered pair

A clever way to define an ordered pair using sets is as:
$$
(x,y) = \set{\set{x},\set{x,y}}
$$

### Cartesian product

The adjectival form of *René Descartes* is Cartesian. That's because the name *Descartes* means "of Cartes", and was translated to Latin as ***Cartesius***.

The Cartesian product of two sets $X$ and $Y$ is defined as
$$
\set{(x,y)\mid x\in X, y\in Y}
$$
notice that the Cartesian product is still a set.

### Relation

Relation is a generalization of the concept of function.
